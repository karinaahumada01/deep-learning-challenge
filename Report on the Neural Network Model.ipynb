    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis was to create a deep learning model capable of predicting whether an applicant funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful. By analyzing historical data, the model can help the nonprofit foundation make informed decisions on which organizations to fund, thereby optimizing resource allocation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- EIN and NAME were removed because they are identifiers and not relevant to the model's prediction.\n"

    "\n",

    "- Validation data was used to monitor model performance during training.\n",

    "- While this is close to the earlier peak accuracy (72.69%), the increase in epochs and added complexity did not significantly improve performance.\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Different numbers of layers (2 to 4, then 4 vs. 6) were tested, and 4 layers performed slightly better overall.\n",
    "- Increased epochs (up to 200) improved model stability but did not significantly enhance accuracy beyond ~72.5%.\n"

    "The deep learning model achieved a maximum accuracy of 72.49%, slightly below the target performance of 75%. Scaling the features significantly improved the modelâ€™s performance, demonstrating the importance of preprocessing in deep learning.\n",
